Desktop version: https://github.com/orYoffe/fighting-desktop-game

# Instructions

  Just open the ```index.html``` file in your browser and fight!

# Warning
 - this is old and dangerous code.. do not try to edit it, as it will give you headaches
 - the boy that wrote this (me a few years back) was drinking a lot and liked messy code for some reasons :)
